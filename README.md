# Arduino Keyboard
A simple keyboard emulator for arduino (for those arduinos capable of emulating a USB Keyboard)
Right now this repository has three files:
- README.md (this file)
- keyboard/keyboard.ino (the sourcecode for the keyboard emulator... right now it's a 32 button keyboard for mame)
- multiplexor_teclado.zip (a board that I begin to design, for using a small arduino with a lot of buttons... At the end I bought a bigger arduino, then I have not tested this board).
